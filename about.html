        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Williams II and I am 13 and have a first time start up buisness.. I have been practicing and learning the baiscs and skills of photography for almost one and a half years and have a great grasp on the concepts of ISO, Shutter Speed, and Apeture.</p>
        <p>I know most people wouldn't want a 13-year old photographer at their wedding, capturing their happiest day of their life. But think about it for a moment, give something new a try. I will not disappoint.</p>
        <p>I would be widely open to any offered classes or shadowing a professional photographer I am always open to improvement to give you, the customer, the best photos you can possibly have.</p>
